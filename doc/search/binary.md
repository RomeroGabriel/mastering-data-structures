# Binary Search

Binary search is an efficient algorithm used for finding the position of a target value within a sorted array. `It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half`. If the target value is found, the algorithm `returns its index; otherwise, it returns -1`. This algorithm is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets because of its time complexity of O(log n), making it faster than linear search algorithms for large arrays.

!!! note "Time complexity"
    O(log n)
